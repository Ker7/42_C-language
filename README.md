# 42Wolfsburg projects

Welcome to my repo for C-language. Happy digging!
1. First project: Libft. Here lie the re-writes of mostly standard library's string functions, some memory and lists'stuff aswell.
2. ft_printf - the good old print_f function WITHOUT the exta part of defining the decimal length etc. Working modifiers: "cspdiuxX%"
3. gnl - the great mindbender of a function. If you are not friends with pointers and haven't had a meltdown yet, congratulations! This approach has a memory leak should you stop the reading of a file halfway, but it still passed the school tests. At this point the focus was more on other things.
4. I also did Minitalk and should upload that here. It was a messaging app but only with linux USR1 and USR2 signals(these signals don't hold values). You try to talk with only that...
