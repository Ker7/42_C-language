Theres another one.
Another brave one.
Great. We got work.
No wait, hold on.

we dont want war
we dont want war
we don't want our enemies to die
for theire our ticket to the sky

we don't want global warming
we don't want pandemic
we just want these tasty burgers
we think its pathetic

to be ready for catastrophe my friend
your expecting for a time to bethe end
youre ready, youre ready
youre ready, world stand still
